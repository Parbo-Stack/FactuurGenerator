Create a Dutch invoice generator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js for interactivity). The app should have the following features:

     - KvK-nummer (Chamber of Commerce number)
     - IBAN/BTW-nummer (VAT number)
     - Datum (Date selection with a date picker)
     - Product/Dienst tabel (Product/Service table with columns: description, quantity, price per unit, and total)
     - Automatic BTW (VAT) calculation (9% or 21%)
     - Opmerkingen (Notes) section for additional comments
   - Button to **preview and download invoice as PDF.**

2. **Customization Options:**
   - Logo upload (optional feature)
   - Custom color themes for invoices
   - Currency selection (EUR, USD, GBP)
   - Language toggle: Dutch (default) and English

3. **Export Options:**
   - Download the generated invoice as a **PDF** (use `jsPDF` library).
   - Send invoice via email (using a basic email-sending API).

4. **Monetization:**
   - Integrate **Google AdSense** for ad revenue.
   - Add affiliate banners for bookkeeping services such as Moneybird or Exact Online.
   - Place ads in non-intrusive areas (sidebar, footer, download confirmation).

5. **User Experience Features:**
   - Responsive design (mobile-first) using **Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.**
   - Save the last entered invoice data in **LocalStorage** for easy retrieval.
   - One-click invoice number increment for sequential numbering.

6. **Advanced Features (Optional):**
   - Invoice history storage (Firebase for free cloud storage).
   - Recurring invoice generator for premium users (paid feature).
   - Generate QR codes for payment links (Tikkie, iDEAL).

7. **Technical Implementation Details:**
   - Use React.js for frontend interactivity.
   - Use `jsPDF` for generating PDF invoices.
   - Store user data locally with `localStorage` for session persistence.
   - Deploy the frontend using **Vercel or Firebase Hosting.**

8. **Marketing Features:**
   - Add basic SEO optimizations (meta tags, schema.org markup).
   - Include social media sharing buttons for easy sharing.

9. **Design Considerations:**
   - Keep UI minimalistic, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.
   - Add a friendly welcome message and step-by-step guidance.
   - Include a "feedback" button to collect user suggestions.

Please include detailed comments in the code for clarity, and structure the code in a modular way for future scalability.

Deploy the app to a free hosting platform and ensure the site is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
